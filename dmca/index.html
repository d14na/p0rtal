                        <br />We do not have any content.
                        <br />We are not a bittorrent site, we are just a tracker, we can not see what content is behind an info_hash.
                        <br />We don't have any torrent files.
                        <br />We can't give you any IP addresses in any other way than normal tracker usage.
                        <br />We can't verify any claims when we have no data other than the info_hash.
                        <br />We can't block info_hash keys from being registered with the tracker.
                        <br />We don't have any logs or ways to trace previous connections, It's not technically possible to trace connection history due to the sheer volume of connections. The only information that is possible to keep is the current torrent swarm.
